# 💫 About Me

I’m **Dev Nairb**, a software engineer with a strong foundation in **computer science** and a deep interest in building systems that are **correct, secure, and maintainable**.

I enjoy working **from first principles**—understanding how systems behave under real constraints, how data flows through them, and where they can fail—then designing solutions that are simple, explicit, and easy to reason about. I value clarity in both code and design, and I prefer engineering decisions that hold up over time rather than quick or clever fixes.

My GitHub is structured as a **domain-oriented engineering workspace**. Each repository represents real work: a complete system, a focused experiment, or a learning track backed by implementation, documentation, and iteration. This profile reflects **intentional engineering effort and continuous learning**, not tutorials or filler repositories.

I place strong emphasis on **clean, readable, and intentional code**, solid fundamentals in data structures and systems, and building software with **security, performance, and scalability** in mind. Clear documentation and reproducibility are core parts of how I work.
